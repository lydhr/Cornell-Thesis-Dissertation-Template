This thesis would not have been possible without the support and guidance of many who shaped my understanding of the magical world.

First and foremost, I dedicate this work to the memory of my parents, James and Lily Potter, whose love and sacrifice provided me with the most fundamental understanding of protection. Their legacy has been the constant inspiration for my research.

My deepest gratitude goes to Professor Albus Dumbledore. His profound wisdom, unwavering trust, and belief in knowledge and courage guided every step of my journey. His mentorship was the true cornerstone of this research.

To my dearest friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, thank you for your unwavering support, your brilliant minds, and your boundless courage. Hermione, your keen intellect and academic rigor were invaluable in transforming practical experience into a coherent theoretical framework.

I am also indebted to the many instructors who shaped my understanding, including Professor Minerva McGonagall’s firm yet fair guidance and the complex perspectives of Professor Remus Lupin and Alastor "Mad-Eye" Moody. Even in his difficult role, Professor Severus Snape’s deep knowledge of the Dark Arts provided me with an essential view.

Finally, I thank my family, especially my wife, Ginny, whose strength and support have always been my anchor. This work is for the next generation, to ensure they have the tools to face a world made safer because we understood its dangers.
