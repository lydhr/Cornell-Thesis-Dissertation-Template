\chapter{Pushing the Limits of Defensing Against the Dark Arts Spells}
This research explores the operational capacity and endurance of the newly developed generalized magical defense framework. By subjecting the techniques to extreme magical stress and high-intensity simulations, this paper validates their efficacy in high-stakes, battle-readiness scenarios. The findings provide crucial insights into the physical and magical strain of the defensive methods, making them invaluable for training advanced practitioners and Aurors who must confront powerful dark magic with minimal margin for error.~\cite{pushlimits2025magic}
